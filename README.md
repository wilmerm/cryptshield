# Secure Encryption, Deletion, and Metadata Cleaning Application

This Python application allows you to securely encrypt files and directories using the **Fernet** library, permanently delete them with the **shred** command, and clean metadata from various file formats. It is useful for protecting sensitive data and ensuring it cannot be recovered.

## **Main Features**

- **Secure Encryption:** Uses the Fernet library to encrypt files and directories with a user-provided key.
- **Permanent Deletion:** Securely removes files and directories using the **shred** command.
- **Metadata Cleaning:** Removes metadata from images, documents, PDFs, and multimedia files while preserving file functionality.
- **Recursive Processing:** Supports encrypting and deleting files within directories recursively.
- **User Confirmation Options:** Can be configured to require user confirmation before encrypting or deleting files.

## **Requirements**

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `cryptography`, `piexif`, `pillow`, `PyPDF2`, `python-docx`, `openpyxl`, `mutagen`

## **Usage**

### **Running `cryptshield`**

#### Basic syntax:

```sh
cryptshield [COMMAND] [OPTION1] [OPTION2]
```

#### Examples:

```sh
# Encrypt a file
cryptshield encrypt /path/to/file secret_key

# Decrypt a file
cryptshield decrypt /path/to/file.encrypted secret_key

# Encrypt a text
cryptshield encrypt_text "Sample text" secret_key
"gAAAAABnsO0xV07ndDmt-fO..."

# Decrypt a text
cryptshield decrypt_text "gAAAAABnsO0xV07ndDmt-fO..." secret_key
"Sample text"

# Secure file deletion
cryptshield delete /path/to/file

# Clean metadata from files
cryptshield clean_metadata /path/to/image.jpg /path/to/document.pdf

# Clean metadata with essential information preserved
cryptshield clean_metadata /path/to/file.jpg true true true

# Clean metadata without backup (not recommended)
cryptshield clean_metadata /path/to/file.pdf false false true
```

## **Metadata Cleaning Feature**

The metadata cleaning feature provides secure removal of metadata from various file formats while maintaining the primary functionality of files. This feature complies with DoD 5220.22-M standards for secure deletion.

### **Supported File Formats**

- **Images:** JPEG, PNG, TIFF, GIF
  - Removes: EXIF data, GPS coordinates, camera information, comments, timestamps
- **Documents:** PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX
  - Removes: Author information, creation/modification dates, comments, document properties, edit history
- **Multimedia:** MP3, MP4, AVI, MOV, WAV, FLAC
  - Removes: ID3 tags, artist, album, comments, metadata
- **Text Files:** TXT, RTF
  - Removes: File system metadata where applicable

### **Metadata Cleaning Options**

1. **preserve_essential** (true/false): Whether to preserve essential metadata like title and creator
2. **backup** (true/false): Whether to create backups before cleaning (recommended)
3. **verify** (true/false): Whether to verify metadata removal after cleaning

### **Security Features**

- **Secure Backup Management:** Creates temporary backups during processing, removes them after successful verification
- **Verification Process:** Confirms metadata has been successfully removed
- **Audit Logging:** Detailed logs of all metadata cleaning operations
- **DoD 5220.22-M Compliance:** Follows secure deletion standards
- **Forensic Recovery Prevention:** Ensures metadata cannot be recovered

### **Examples**

```sh
# Basic metadata cleaning
cryptshield clean_metadata /path/to/photo.jpg

# Clean multiple files
cryptshield clean_metadata /path/to/photo.jpg /path/to/document.pdf /path/to/music.mp3

# Preserve essential metadata (title, creator)
cryptshield clean_metadata /path/to/document.pdf true

# Clean without backup (faster, but less safe)
cryptshield clean_metadata /path/to/file.jpg false

# Full control: preserve_essential=false, backup=true, verify=true
cryptshield clean_metadata /path/to/file.jpg false true true
```
